          Nigeria’s youth unemployment rate is 42.5%. This implies that more
          than 4 out of every 10 Nigerian youths that can work and available to
          work can not find work. More so, Lagos also ranked the worst states
          with the rate of unemployment having about 2 million people without
          jobs according to a 2020 report by Statisence.

          Nigeria simply does not generate or distribute enough power to meet

          In the 21st century where the world is driven by knowledge, the
          greatest investment is development of human capital. I believe that
          education holds the strongest potential in transforming any society.
          This is why United Nations recommend a sizeable amount of our annual
          budget towards ensuring that families have access to quality basic
          education for their kids. In Lagos Central, the situation is different
          where public schools are inadequate and private schools are very
          expensive. More than 80% of Lagos Central families send their kids to
          private schools (from kindergarten to University) because public
          schools are not great. These have to change. These and much more are
